# SD12 Environment Sensor System

This was a university project implementing an environmental monitoring system using embedded C++ programming. This system captures, processes, and manages environmental sensor data through coordinated hardware (Arduino) and software. The Arduino board had a LCD display with a menu, allowing the user to adjust settings, review data or send commands manually.

Pverall, using SD-12 communication protocol, the aim of this project was to gather environment data on an Arduino device, log the data, and have it sent to another device when requested. The project was a success 🎉

## 📊 System Architecture

## 📖 Documentation

I included the report we created for this project, to try and give a little more context into exactly what this code needed to achieve.
