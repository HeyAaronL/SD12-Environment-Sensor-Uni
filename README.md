# SD12 Environment Sensor System

This was a university project implementing an environmental monitoring system using embedded C++ programming. This system captures, processes, and manages environmental sensor data through coordinated hardware (Arduino) and software.

## 📋 Project Overview

Using SD-12 communication protocol, the aim of this project was to gather environment data on an Arduino device, log the data, and have it sent to another device when requested. It was built through the Arduino IDE, using C++.

## 📊 System Architecture

Refer to the included flowcharts for how the codebase works:
- `CodebaseFlowchart.png` - Overall system data flow
- `CommandCentreFlowchart.png` - Command center operation logic

## 📖 Documentation

I included the report we created for this project, to try and give a little more context into exactly what this code needed to achieve.
